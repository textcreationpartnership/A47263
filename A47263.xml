            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIs not the apprehenſion of any Worth or Excellency in this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> (except what its Subject Matter imports) that could tempt me to the Publication of it: Nor am I ſo vain as to think, that any thing of mine ſhould find ſuch Acceptance in a learned and critical Age, but that the Dread of its ſevere Cenſures would rather deter me from appearing in public, then the Opinion of my own

<pb facs="tcp:102388:7"/>Morning and Evening, both with your <hi>Families,</hi> and in your <hi>Cloſets.</hi> Yet ſo, that (when Opportunitie's preſent) you do not neglect the more ſolemn and public <hi>Service of the Church,</hi> for the wilful Omiſſion of this important and neceſſary Duty of <hi>Religion,</hi> as 'tis highly diſhonourable to God, a Scandal to our holy Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and of very dangerous and damnable Conſequence to all, but to Maſters of Families eſpecially, who have the chief and immediate Charge of, and Inſpection over the reſt; ſo, if it be ſincerely and devoutly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, this will intitle you to, and qualifie you not only for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and Bleſſings of this, but a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and better Life: Nor have I the leaſt cauſe to doubt, but that my well meant Endeavours herein, will meet with a ready and kind Acceptance, from you eſpecially. And may your hearty Compliance with the <hi>Truth and Duties</hi> herein recommended,
<pb facs="tcp:102388:7"/>bring you by degrees, to the perfect Knowledge and Practice of true Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Holineſs; and make you abound ſtill more and more in all the Virtues and Graces of the inner-man, to the Praiſe and Glory of our infinite Creator and Redeemer.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> (I hope) will prove ſo agreeable to the primitive Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> that the <hi>Excellency and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs</hi> thereof, (as the Title imports) are in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure repreſented, both in its <hi>Principles and Practices.</hi> A <hi>Religion,</hi> which ſhews the Dignity of Chriſt's Perſon, the Sufficiency of his Merits, and the faithful Adminiſtration of his Offices; by vertue whereof, <hi>he is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption.</hi> A <hi>Religion,</hi> which above all things teacheth us to be godly and honeſt, pure and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and to abound in all the Fruits of Piety, Juſtice, Charity, Sobriety, Loyalty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in all and every
<pb facs="tcp:102388:8"/>one of theſe <hi>without partiality, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hypocriſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And herein I have endeavour'd to be ſerious and practical, rather then make uſe of any vain glorious Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Wit and Eloquence; and have not fail'd to beg the Aſſiſtances of God's Grace and holy Spirit to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me in the Compoſure. Beſides, the private Satisfaction I have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd already, and the Benefit which (I hope) you'l reap by it, will not only compenſate all the hard Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures I can meet with; but ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly countervail all my Pains and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues herein. Nor am I concern'd for any more in this World, then to diſcharge the Duties of my Calling with a good Conſcience, and leave behind me a good Example. I have not much troubled my <hi>Reader,</hi> with the Quotation of thoſe <hi>Authors</hi> I have made uſe of. And the Faults which have eſcap'd the Preſs are neither ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many nor material; yet there are
<pb facs="tcp:102388:8"/>ſome, which I deſire he will either candidly cenſure, or correct.</p>
            <p>And now, let us all indeavour (as we are oblig'd by the many power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Motives of Duty and Intereſt) to adorn this moſt <hi>excellent Religion of the holy and eternal Jeſus,</hi> by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken Faith in its Principles, and hearty Compliance with all its juſt and reaſonable Commands and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions whatſoever. So that we may reap in this World Satisfaction and Peace of Mind, and in the World to come Life everlaſting. And if this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> (now that 'tis made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic,) may any way conduce to the magnifying of God's Glory, and the Intereſt of his Church; (which is the Argument of it) I ſhall return him moſt hearty and unfeigned Thanks for the Succeſs, and my Friends for the Encouragement in the Publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now, to God's merciful Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, Protection, and Bleſſing I commit you: And as the Aſſiſtance
<pb facs="tcp:102388:9"/>of your Prayers, to enable me the better to diſcharge my Duty in the Miniſterial Office, is not the leaſt Part of my Happineſs; (for the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Miniſter and People are reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal,) ſo I doubt not, but 'twill be Comfort and Satisfaction to you, to have this Aſſurance from me, that I am in all Sincerity,</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:102388:10"/>'Tis too obvious, That the whole Race of Mankind by the Fall and defection of our firſt Parents, (in violating the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant) have not only obſcur'd the Light of Reaſon, and Divine Knowledge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might perfectly have underſtood their Duties both to God and Man; but have ſo deprav'd their Wills, and impair'd their ſtrength, that ſuch an impotency has ſeiz'd our Faculties, both as to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God's Will, and the Power of performing it; That we've <hi>now</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt want imaginable, <hi>as</hi> of a clearer Light to diſcover our <hi>Duties</hi> to us with greater certainty, whereby we might know what is the good and acceptable will of God; <hi>So</hi> of more powerful Encouragements and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances, that by the gracious Influences of God's holy Spirit, we might be enabl'd to conduct our Lives, in a ſincere and ſtedfaſt Conformity to the Divine Will and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>And to this End, God Almighty was pleas'd to inſtitute the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a more perfect Rule and Tranſcript of our Obedience, than that of Nature (as now deprav'd,) and <hi>writ it himſelf in Tables of Stone</hi> that it might laſt the longer.

               <p n="3">(3) The <hi>Truth</hi> of this excellent Doctrine which he deliver'd,<note place="margin">By Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</note> was confirm'd by real &amp; inexceptionable <hi>Miracles;</hi> ſuch as neither the Devil, nor any of his Agents, either Sorcerer or Magician were able to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.

But our Heavenly Law-giver has recommended the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> to our Belief, and Practice, by other <hi>Motives</hi> and <hi>Credentials;</hi> and has ſettled it in moſt of the known Parts of the World, by other Means and Methods: For a few days before his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion into Heaven, he gave Commiſſions to,<note place="margin">Matt. 28.19, 20.</note> and inveſted his Apoſtles, and Diſciples with Power, and inſpir'd them with Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to Preach this <hi>Doctrine of Salvation</hi> to, and propagate it in the World. And this was not the leaſt <hi>Miracle</hi> in it; that a few Perſons of the loweſt Extract, ſlender Education, and arm'd with no external Power, (the moſt of 'em being poor Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, as Tent-makers, Carpenters, Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſuch like) ſhould be able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all the Authority, Wit, Learning, Policy, and Eloquence of the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, Politicians, and Philoſophers on Earth, and all the Devils and damned Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in Hell, which were combin'd againſt them; and in deſpight of Malice it ſelf, to eſtabliſh a <hi>Religion</hi> which did ſo much check and control the Ambitions, Intereſts, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

               <p>And yet notwithſtanding all theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, the Apoſtles and Diſciples of our Lord had wonderful <hi>Succeſs</hi> in Eſtabliſhing the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> triumphing over and trampling upon the greateſt Oppoſitions; and did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, and its <hi>Excellent Author,</hi> with the higheſt Manifeſtations of Zeal, and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; tho' continual Reproaches, and Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies, Racks and Priſons, Flames and Martyrdoms, did await 'em in every place where they came: For we've a certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the twelve Apoſtles, and many Thouſands of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd violent Deaths, by the hands of thoſe who perſecuted them, meerly for their <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what rational Motive could carry 'em through ſuch an hazardous Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that Chriſtians alone ſhould ſeem ſo fond of ſufferings, that they forgot Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity it ſelf, indured Torments, and abode the Flames not only with Patience, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102388:14"/>Magnanimity, but with joy? For tho' this Chriſtian Courage was lookt on by the moſt, to be either the folly or Phrenſie of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper'd Brain; yet doubtleſs it could be no leſs than the abſolute convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Minds and Conſciences of the <hi>Truth</hi> and certainty of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which they deliver'd; with a comfortable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thoſe inconceivable Rewards which ſhould await 'em in another World.</p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> has been always hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and ſhall be ever propagated by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rather than Arms; by ſubmiſſion and ſufferings, rather than force and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: And has (far beyond all humane conceit) been attended with ſuch wonderful <hi>Succceſs</hi> and Prevalency, without any kind of Power or Earthly Authority to back it, and not ſo much as one Sword (except that of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 27.52, 53.</note> for which our bleſſed Saviour ſeverely reprov'd him) has been drawn in the defence of it: Inſomuch that 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any thing but <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf, which has an Omnipotent and over-ruling force in it, could (by ſuch weak and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Methods</hi>) have ſo ſoon ſubdu'd mankind to the Faith, and obtain'd a Victory over the hearts of Men in ſo great a part of the World.</p>

                  <hi>He ſaid unto them, handle me, and ſee, for a Spirit hath not Fleſh, and Bones, as ye ſee me have.</hi> Now what can be more evident (ſince the Scripture is every where full to this purpoſe) then this, that the Son of God aſſum'd the true Nature of Man, and the very ſubſtance of his Mother, and that <hi>he</hi> was not only made in her, but born of her.

                  <hi>His Birth,</hi> manner of <hi>Life, Death, Burial, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſcention</hi> are full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Demonſtrations of the reality of his <hi>Manhood.</hi> But with reference to our <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi> he was ſubject to Cold and Heat; Hunger and Thirſt; Sweating and Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Wearineſs and Weakneſs; Pain and Sorrow; Heavineſs and Fear; Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſinleſs Anger; yea Torment and Death it ſelf. All which <hi>Arguments</hi> are ſo cogent and convictive, that neither the <hi>Hereticks</hi> of Old, nor the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Libertines</hi> of our Age, ever were, nor ever ſhall be able to elnde the Power and Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of them.

               <p n="1">(1) In the <hi>Incarnation of our Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Point; by conſidering its Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on Practice.</note> we have an admirable Inſtance of God's ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt <hi>Love and Compaſſion</hi> to poor ſinful Man: For what kindneſs could parallel this, that the Father ſhould ſend, and the Son condeſcend to come from his Boſom and Bliſs, upon that great Ambaſſie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our Peace, even then, when by our ſin and Diſobedience we had violated his juſt Laws; broken the <hi>Covenant</hi> between God and us, and put our ſelves into a ſtate of <hi>Hoſtility</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt him?
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102388:26"/>But beſides all this, 'tis an evident matter of Fact, (as will fully appear afterwards) that Chriſt the Son of God, and Heir of eternal Majeſty, did not only deſcend from thoſe Regions of Bliſs, and aſſum'd our <hi>whole Nature</hi> with all its <hi>Properties</hi> and <hi>Infirmities:</hi> But he alſo underwent the Burden and Smart of all our ſins, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; and having finiſhed his innocent Life, he ſubmitted to all the Tortures, and Indignities of a painful and ignominious Death for our ſakes.

               <p>That Almighty God out of the Virgin Earth created man, and <hi>breathed into his Noſtrils the Breath of Life,</hi> was indeed a great <hi>Miracle:</hi> But that a Virgin ſhould conceive and bear a Son that was both God and Man was far greater.

               <p>And without all controverſie,<note place="margin">Chriſt the Prophet</note> this is <hi>he</hi> whom God the <hi>Father</hi> promis'd to ſend into the World; whom the Prophet <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> tells us ſhould be <hi>anointed to Preach the Goſpel:</hi> And being com'd into theſe lower Regions, was confirm'd in this <hi>Office</hi> by an audible Voice from Heaven, three times repeated, (as before) with this peremptory Command annext to <hi>his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102388:45"/>Commiſſion, Hear ye him. His Miſſion</hi> was alſo confirm'd by many notable Signs and Wonders; by the Teſtimony of his Harbinger <hi>John the Baptiſt;</hi> and many other infallible <hi>Proofs</hi> which would be needleſs to mention here. But beſides, the Diſpoſition and Temper of his Mind was every way ſutable to <hi>his Office</hi> and Authority: For, his Wiſdom and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, Purity and Holineſs,<note place="margin">His Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications</note> Courage and Conſtancy, Meekneſs and Patience, Sweetneſs and Goodneſs, Power and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty (conſpicuous in all <hi>his</hi> Diſcourſes and Demeanour) are ſo many unanſwerable Topics to prove, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>anointed with the holy Spirit, and with Power;</hi> that <hi>he</hi> might be every way qualified for the due <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of this high and <hi>extraordinary Office of a Prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which <hi>Office</hi> (in the moſt ſtrict ſenſe) denotes, that the Perſon inveſted with it ſhould be inſpir'd with extraordinary <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> to <hi>Propheſie</hi> of and foretel things to come. And tho' our <hi>Anointed Saviour,</hi> could not be deficient in this; (ſince his Wiſdom and Knowledge are infinite) yet his <hi>Prophetical Office</hi> is to be underſtood in a larger <hi>Acceptation;</hi> and does import a Perſon endu'd with the extraordinary Gifts of Divine Wiſdom and Authority; to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret</hi>

And this muſt be done, (1) by repelling all Injuries and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies which may tend to the Ruine or Prejudice of either: And this imports an Abſtinence from, and a hearty Abhorrence of all Sin. (2) By conſulting and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all the prudent and rational Means and Methods which may conduce to our comfortable ſubſiſtence in this World, and will diſpoſe and qualifie us for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and Happineſs of that State which we hope for in a better.</p>
               <p>Now, theſe virtuous and vitious Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, are either ſuch as reſpect the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Miſery of the <hi>whole Man;</hi> as <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Moderation:</hi> Or they have a more peculiar reſpect; ſome to the <hi>Souls,</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:102388:64"/>others to the <hi>Bodies of Men</hi> diſtinctly. We ſhall treat of all theſe ſeverally, and in Order. And we begin</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety</hi> of neceſſary Uſ, for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of coul and Body.</note> With <hi>Sobriety or Moderation.</hi> Theſe twin-Virtues (which we ſhall han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle together) are of ſpecial uſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance for the Government of all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, Affections, Deſires, and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of the <hi>whole Man;</hi> that we may be able to confine them to thoſe due Bounds and Meaſures, which <hi>Chriſtian Prudence</hi> has aſſign'd them.</p>
               <p>And if we be truly <hi>ſober and moderate,</hi> we ſhall not be ſtudious to indulge and pleaſe thoſe Appetites and Paſſions, which are always ready to comply with every Sin and Temptation, to the great diſquiet and prejudice of our rational Powers: For if we ſtudy to pleaſe and gratifie our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates with delicate Meats and Drinks; the Touch with Softneſs and Effeminacy; the Eye with fair and gaudy Shows; the Ear with harmonious and pleaſant Sounds; the Smell with fragrant &amp; coſtly Perfumes: <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such Allurements as theſe do ſo influence and bewitch the ſenſual Appetites and Paſſions, that the Reaſon and Judgement will be forc'd not only to quit their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Authority; but they become ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to all the baſe Ends and Deſigns, which theſe imperious and domineering
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102388:64"/>Uſurpers ſhall deſire 'em to comply with. And what can be expected in this Diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, but a fruitleſs variety of Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Diſappointments? If then we ſet a greater value on theſe Things then they are capable of, 'tis impoſſible that we ſhould be ſatisfied with 'em whenever we enjoy them: For 'tis moſt notoriouſly evident, That no man has that guſt and pleaſure in the Acqueſt of worldly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, which he propounded to himſelf and ſo eagerly expected whilſt he was in purſuit after them. Beſides 'tis conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that all the things of this World are flitting and tranſitory; and in a few Years (perhaps in a few Minutes) we ſhall be ſtript naked of every thing we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, except the good or bad Qualities and Diſpoſitions of our Souls: Now if it ſhould happen when we come to die, that our Souls ſhould be hankering after the Pleaſures of Senſe, we ſhould carry our Affections into another World, and leave their Objects behind us. And judge ye, in what a miſerable ſtate and Condition thoſe poor Creatures will be in, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part this Life with ſuch Appetites and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections as theſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore, (upon theſe Conſiderations) how ſhould we proportion our Deſires and Inclinations to the value of thoſe things
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102388:65"/>are delighted and pleas'd with. And the Enjoyments of this World ſhould only affect us ſo far, as they become ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the things of God, and the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and intellectual Pleaſures of the Soul; and till our Affections be <hi>thus</hi> cultivated by Grace and Virtue, we can have no true Reliſh of Spiritual and Heavenly Delights: For if we devote our ſelves to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Senſe, they cannot ſatisfie the Deſires of the Soul, but do only comply with and indulge the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and extravagant Appetites of the Body.</p>
               <p>Hence then it muſt needs follow by the <hi>Rule of Contraries;</hi> that the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of wicked and <hi>intemperate</hi> Men in this World (who being inſlav'd by their Luſts and Appetites) are like a Veſſel in the midſt of a rugged and tempeſtuous Sea, which is in danger to be ſhipwrackt by every Wind and Wave, by every Luſt and Temptation: A thouſand croſs Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents (both within and without) do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually perplex and torment 'em, which Fleſh and Bloud are not able to encounter nor endure; and to add to their Miſery they are alwayes attended with a ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of new and unexpected Miſchiefs. This is the worſt part of Hell, and far more perplexing than whole Legions of infernal
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102388:65"/>Fiends without them: Since then, theſe <hi>bruitiſh Paſſions</hi> have ſuch a miſchievous Influence, to turn Angels into Devils; how can any Man hope to be happy, ſo long as he ſuffers ſuch <hi>Furies</hi> to rule and reign over him? There's no way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be at Peace with God, and Man, and our own Conſciences; but by ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſenſual Appetites and Paſſions; and reducing 'em by <hi>Sobriety and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> under the Empire and Soveraignty of rectified Reaſon and Religion: Otherwiſe, if 'twere poſſible that we ſhould be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with ſuch uneaſie and troubleſome Companions, we ſhould find nothing there to pleaſe us; but be rather deſirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the lower World, to react theſe ſenſual Pleaſures which are moſt correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to our bruitiſh Tempers and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Sobriety and Moderation</hi> are the Harbingers, which (by the Aſſiſtance of God's Grace) do diſpoſe and qualifie a Chriſtian for all other <hi>Virtues;</hi> and there muſt be a concurrence of 'em all to make as truly wiſe and truly good.

               </p>
               <p>Our own Experience will inform us, That the Things of this World (which are uſually eſteem'd and valued by worldly minded men) are not eaſily got, difficult to keep, and do often procure ſo much Malice, Envy, and Danger to thoſe that poſſeſs them, that the Worldling's life can be no other than a continued Series of Trouble and Diſcompoſure: But thoſe who have no other Aims than the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Supplies of Nature, and are not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the fruitleſs Vanity of being rich or honourable in this World; but place their whole Deſires and Delights in the exerciſe of Piety and Virtue, and in Contemplation of the Riches of Gods Grace in Chriſt, and that ſuture Happineſs which we aſpire to: Thoſe <hi>heavenly minded</hi> Chriſtians (I ſay) who have arriv'd at
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102388:66"/>this divine Frame and Temper of Mind, do trample upon all the little Projects and Fooleries of this World; enjoy a Heaven upon Earth; and live little leſs than the Life of glorified Angels and Saints, whilſt by a Mind content with little, they imitate their want of nothing.</p>
               <p>Now, this <hi>Heavenly Diſpoſition</hi> is moſt ſutable and correſpondent to the Genius and Spirit of Chriſtianity, and the Doctrine and Example of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: Who commands us to pray, not for Delicacies and Superfluities to pamper and pleaſe our wanton Curioſity; (and if they are not to be prai'd for, they are not worth the having) but for daily Bread, and ſuch Accomodations of Life, as may keep our Bodies in Health, that they may be fit for Action, and more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the <hi>Soul.</hi> When we've rais'd our Faculties to this Pitch of Purity and Holineſs, 'twill be no difficult Task to part with our Fathers, Mothers, Wives, Children, the deareſt Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Houſes, Lands, and whatever elſe may be eſteemed valuable in this World, if they ſhould come in Competition with Chriſt, and the intereſt of our precious and immortal <hi>Souls.</hi> In a word, this <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Frame</hi> and Temper of mind and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, will teach us to bear with Aequanimity
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102388:67"/>all the croſs Accidents which may happen to our Perſons and Poſſeſſions: For there's nothing can fall amiſs to that Perſon that is divinely diſpos'd.

Thus <hi>as</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> is in, but not of the Body; ſo Heavenly minded Men may be in, but not of the World: But with paſſionate Groans and Cries, (yet always ſubmitting to the Will and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God) <hi>they deſire to be diſſolv'd and to be with Chriſt,</hi>

               <p>To enforce the Practice of this excellent <hi>Vertue:</hi> We have the concurrent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of our bleſſed Saviour and his Apoſtles; which are written every where in the New Teſtament in ſuch lively and legible Characters, that I need not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in Particulars: We have the holy Angels alſo for our <hi>Patterns;</hi> who (tho they be advanc'd to the higheſt Pinacle of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Happineſs,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.14.</note> yet) are <hi>miniſtring Spirits</hi> to the Sons of Men, for their Weal and Preſervation.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102388:68"/>if we apply theſe things ſeriouſly to our Selves; we ſhall appear like ſo many Lamps in the Sight of the Sun; and thoſe little remains of Wiſdom, and the fond Conceits which we are ſo apt to admire in our ſelves, and undervalue in others, would expire and vaniſh: A modeſt <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Self denial</hi> would take Poſſeſſion of our Minds and Spirits, and the Effects of it would appear in our whole Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with, and deportment towards one another.</p>
               <p>Again 'tis reaſonable to conſider; that whatever we are, and whatever we have, (our Beings and Well-beings) are the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Product and Penſions of God's Bounty; who can in a moment diſpoſſeſs us of our deareſt and moſt pleaſant Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: He is the Proprietor, we are but his Uſu-fructuaries: And for this <hi>Time</hi> of our mortal Life; and all theſe <hi>Talents</hi> which he has entruſted us with, we muſt be ſtrictly accountable at the Day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102388:72"/>ſame Head of Diſcourſe.

               </p>
               <p>Therefore, why ſhould any <hi>Affliction</hi> in this World diſſwade us from our Duty, or abate our Zeal and Courage in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: For the Inſtruments of our Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) are the Enſigns of our Honour and Happineſs;<note place="margin">Tert.

Let us but hold out a little longer, till we come within the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of the new <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and there we ſhall have a total Exemption both from ſinning and ſuffering. Beſides, if we be conſiderable Proficients in <hi>theſe Virtues,</hi> They'l make our preſent Sufferings leſs burdenſome and afflictive: For we ſhall neither be timerous in Danger, envious in Want, impatient under Troubles, angry and reſtleſs at Reproaches and Contempt;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102388:73"/>nor malicious and revengeful under Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Perſecutions; the truth whereof is as clear as the Sun Beams, from the Experience of all ſound Chriſtians. But to be angry and impatient at our <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> will but fret and torment us; and make the Burden of them far more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and inſupportable: Whereas, by a patient Submiſſion to the Will and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God under the manifold <hi>Preſſures</hi> of this Life, they will become far more tolerable and eaſie to be endured.

We begin</p>
               <p n="1">(1) With <hi>Commutative Juſtice;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative.</note> which is wholly converſant in the ordinary Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of Buſineſs between Man and Man. This obligeth all Men mutually to conſult their own, &amp; Neighbours Advantage in their Commerce and Converſation with them. That fundamental Law of Nature,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102388:98"/>which our bleſſed Lord has adapted into the Chriſtian Religion of dealing with others <hi>bona fide,</hi> as we deſire to be dealt with our ſelves, muſt be kept inviolable in our whole Intercourſe with one another. Every Mans Conſcience ſhould be a private <hi>Chancery</hi> and Court of Equity in his own Boſom. And unleſs we make this Golden Rule the Standard to regulate our Affairs by, all other acts of Piety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are no better than painted Hypocriſie,<note place="margin">Mic. 6.11.</note> and moſt abominable in the ſight of God and all good Men.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Gentlemen have been no great Friends to the Chriſtian Religion, who ſo eagerly diſpute againſt Morality, (as they pretend) for the advancement of free Grace. As if both ſides of this Contradiction could be true, that a Man might be godly and diſhoneſt at the ſame time; and be a pure Diſciple of the firſt, whilſt he's an open Enemy to, and tranſgreſſor of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the ſecond Table; ſo that no man (in their ſenſe) can be Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically righteous, unleſs he be Morally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous. But if they would examine the whole <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine</hi> impartially, they may be ſatisfied (if they pleaſe,) that an honeſt upright Carriage, ſpeaking Truth to our Neighbour, the keeping of a Man's Word; performing Oaths and Promiſes;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:102388:99"/>the acting ſincerely and conſcientiouſly in all our Dealings with other Men, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of that <hi>Religion,</hi> which our bleſſed Saviour came to preach and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate in the World.</p>
               <p>But I would ſtudiouſly avoid all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and ſhall only deſire <hi>them,</hi> and all Chriſtians to conſider; that this excellent <hi>Religion</hi> which we profeſs does oblige us to be candid and ingenuous, to meaſure all our Words by our Meaning, ſo, that we neither pretend what's falſe, nor conceal what's true; but make Truth and Equity, Juſtice and Honeſty the Common Baſis and Standard of all humane Tranſactions: For to lye, and ſwear, and diſſemble, for the promoting of Mens Intereſts in this World, are Stratagems which the Devil has always made uſe of, to allure and entrap all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate and worldly-minded Men. And indeed, 'tis highly incongruous, and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Genius and Spirit of Chriſtianity, to diſſemble and deny the Truth; and every ſincere Chriſtian will abhor and abandon thoſe Methods, of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſecular Intereſts by Lyes and Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>Again, this <hi>Juſtice</hi> does oblige us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all our Promiſes and Contracts, (which are neither unlawful, nor impoſſible to be kept) tho' to our greateſt prejudice; and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102388:99"/>unleſs theſe be faithfully obſerv'd, as the Government we live under may be endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd: So no Man can be ſafe, either in his Perſon, or Poſſeſſions. Nor ſhould we wilfully tranſgreſs any of thoſe Laws of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and Sincerity; nor make uſe of any Man's Neceſſity, Ignorance Paſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to enrich our Selves, or advance our Eſtates in this World.

               <p>But our Obligations herein will more evidently appear, if we conſider the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi> part of this <hi>Duty;</hi> which forbids all Entrenchment on other men's Rights, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away their Cattle, Money, Houſes, Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> either by Fraud, or Violence. And this <hi>Injuſtice</hi> is either (1) of the <hi>Heart,</hi> which is extended to all thoſe ſeveral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects mention'd before, which we ſhould not Covet nor deſire; and a Sin expreſly contradictory to, and forbidden in the <hi>tenth Commandment.</hi> (2) There's the <hi>Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> of the <hi>Mouth:</hi> As in uſing deceitful Words and falſe Pretences to cheat and over-reach one another in buying and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or in perſwading an Heir by falſe and flattering Speeches to quit his Intereſt in all, or any part of his Eſtate; or when a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102388:100"/>is wrought on by Fraud or Force, to tranſfer the Title of that Inheritance, which of right belong'd to the Children of the firſt, to thoſe of her ſecond Husband. Or laſtly, when Schiſmatical and Seditious Perſons, by their ſmooth and deceitful Language, do not only allure and perſwade others to ſubſtract their Obedience from their <hi>lawful Superiors;</hi> but do decoy them by degrees to joyn with 'em, in all their vile and unwarrantable Practices of Faction and Rebellion. (3) There's the <hi>Injuſtice</hi> of the <hi>Hand,</hi> which conſiſts in taking away the Eſtates of other Men, (or any part of them) by Fraud or Injuſtice; or in detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the juſt Wages of Labourers or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; or in not reſtoring the Pledge upon the payment of the Money for which that was the Lender's Security; or in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding the Prince of his Honour and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute; or in corrupting the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the Nation for Bribes; or laſtly, when a man appropriates thoſe things to himſelf, which have been dedicated (by his pious Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors) to the ſervice of God, and the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of his Miniſters: As in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Tyths, and Offerings; or in the ſelling of Eccleſiaſtical Livings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>All which ſeveral kinds of <hi>Injuſtice</hi> are expreſly contradictory to, and forbidden by the Law of Nature, the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102388:100"/>and the poſitive Laws of God, both in the Old and New Teſtaments.

               <p>

               <p>Therefore, in common Charity and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> we are oblig'd to be as tender of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man's <hi>Reputation</hi> as our own. And doubtleſs upon this Account, our bleſſed Saviour has forbidden all ſorts of Lying, Backbiting, Slandering, Railing, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, Cenſoriouſneſs, virulent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Invectives, and all other falſe and politic Devices; whereby the <hi>Repute</hi> and <hi>Credit</hi> of our <hi>Neighbour</hi> may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd and injur'd.

               <p>By theſe and many other Arguments, Examples, Precepts, and Counſels, we are not only oblig'd to preſerve and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Peace</hi> in our Chriſtian Community; but to avoid (as we would do the moſt Peſtilential Diſeaſe) all Factious, Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and turbulent Behaviour in all Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties both Sacred and Civil, whereof we are Members.

               <p>Let all Chriſtians then, of all Ranks and Conditions, ſtudy and endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and propagate public and private <hi>Peace</hi> in Church and State, in their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, in their Families, and in their whole Intercourſe and Converſation with one another.

               <p>Thus it will evidently appear from the Premiſſes; that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our great <hi>Prophet</hi> has not only rectified the Miſtakes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd

He has told us plainly what he has done already, what he will do for us, and what returns of Gratitude he expects from us in this Life, that we may be for ever happy in a better. And to enforce theſe ſaving Methods of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> he vouchſafes unto us the Aſſiſtances of his holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> to reſtrain us from Sin; to encourage us in, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to perform the <hi>Duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> He has been pleas'd likewiſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute an <hi>Order of Men,</hi> and inveſted them with Power and Authority to miniſter in <hi>holy Things,</hi> and to be Ambaſſadors in his ſteade; and has furniſht them with Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to inſtruct and govern his People, and to guide them in the <hi>Ways of Salvation.</hi> And to obtain an honourable Reſpect and Deference to their <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Offices:</hi> (that they might diſcharge their Duties, and manage the Buſineſs of their Callings with Comfort to themſelves, and Succeſs to others) He tells the World; that he will interpret the Reſpect given 'em, and the Injuries done to them as if they were done to himſelf, and to encourage them in the pious Adminiſtration of the <hi>Offices</hi> of their

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of his <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Paſſive Obedience.</hi> All which being put together, are a clear Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:102388:111"/>of that full and undeniable <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the righteous has made to God's <hi>Juſtice</hi> for the Pardon of our Sins, and for the Purchaſe of our Peace and Reconciliation.</p>
               <p>This important Truth (being ſo firmly grounded) muſt obtain and challenge our Belief and practical Aſſent to it; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Cavils of ſome, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Objections of others which have been fram'd againſt it: for if Chriſt has not made a plenary <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for the ſins of all Mankind, then 'twould follow, that the Priviledges of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> are not extenſive to all: and if this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> ſhould be granted; then the Guilt of <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin is of a larger <hi>Extent</hi> then Chriſt's <hi>Merits;</hi> which is ſuch a blaſphemous Conceit as can never enter into the Thoughts of a ſober Chriſtian. Again, it would be Injuſtice to damn the Wicked for their Unbelief, if Chriſt have done and ſuffer'd nothing for them: which would alſo be dangerous to affirm. But to put the matter out of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; 'tis evident from holy Scripture, that <hi>Chriſt died</hi> even <hi>for thoſe that periſh.</hi>

               <p>But this is our Comfort and Happineſs, that tho' the <hi>Devil</hi> may now and then tempt us to Sin; yet our bleſſed Lord's ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tender of our Welfare, that he will cither countermine his Stratagems, (if we be good Chriſtians) or furniſh us with a Sufficiency of Grace and Power to reſiſt and repel them. We have indeed ſome Inſtances in <hi>Sacred Hiſtory</hi> of thoſe who've been yielded a <hi>Prey</hi> to him for a time; yet for that very End and Purpoſe, that their Victories over him might become more illuſtrious: And their Examples are left us on Record, (as in the Caſe of holy <hi>Job,</hi> &amp;c.) that they might be laſting <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents</hi> of God's Grace and Power, and

               <p n="2">(2) And more <hi>Particularly,</hi> He exerciſeth his Dominion over the Church his Body, and every particular Member thereof. <hi>His Kingdom</hi> is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Souls and Conſciences of all true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; where he reigns by his Word and Spirit; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting them in the Ways of Godlineſs by his Grace, that he may diſpoſe and qualifie 'em for his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of glory.</hi> Which <hi>Government over his Church,</hi> is yet more particularly diſplay'd and manifeſted, in theſe two remarkable Inſtances.

And this is moſt ſignally remarkable from the Annals of the Church: For there was never any <hi>Religion</hi> in the World ſo ſeverely perſecuted as the Chriſtian; nor did the Devil and wicked Men ever confederate ſo ſtrongly againſt any Sect of religious Profeſſors, as they have done againſt thoſe who profeſſed the <hi>Doctrine of Chriſt:</hi> And if all the Engins and Methods of Cruelty (as Fire, Faggot, the Teeth of wild Beaſts, Racks, Wheels, Gibbets, Grid-irons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) could have deſtroy'd all the Primitive Chriſtians) our <hi>Religion</hi> had long ere this been baniſht out of the World.</p>

               <p n="2">(2) The Government of Chriſt's Kingdom is <hi>Monarchical,</hi> the very beſt of all <hi>Conſtitutions;</hi> in which, there's an abſolute Concurrence of all Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Wiſdom, and Righteouſneſs, without any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or Diminution: For, as <hi>Chriſt is the Power of God,</hi>

And as he lays his Commands on his Subjects, ſo (which is peculiar to the Subjects of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> only) he gives them Directions, and furniſhes them with Abilities to comply with, and obey all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Inſtitutions. Beſides, this <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government of Chriſt has theſe ſpecial Priviledges to diſtinguiſh it from all others. (1) 'Tis <hi>

But the Politie of Chriſt's Kingdom, as well as his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are unchangable: For 'tis conſtituted and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by ſuch an unerring Wiſdom, that a better cannot be devis'd nor deſir'd; and 'tis ſupported by ſuch an invincible Power, that all the Grandees on Earth, and in Hell ſhall never be able to deſtroy nor diſſolve it:<note place="margin">Luk. 1.32.</note>

               <p n="3">(3) <hi>Chriſt our King</hi> has made an eminent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the <hi>Weal</hi> and Safety of his <hi>Subjects:</hi> For
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:102388:138"/>he gives them the Aſſiſtances of the holy Angels in Heaven, and of his Miniſters and Paſtors on Earth: By whoſe Miniſteries, and the concurrences of his Grace, we are ſupplied with a ſufficiency of Wiſdom to make us Wiſe; of Holineſs to make us Good; and Righteouſneſs to make us Juſt: He affords us a ſure Protection, liberal Maintenance, and unſpeakable Rewards, for thoſe little Tributes and Fealties of Service which we pay him. In a word, his loyal Subjects can want nothing which may be requiſite for their Support and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this Life: But if they ſhould be at any time ſtraitned, by the want of theſe, he will enrich them more abundantly with ſpiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Bleſſings.

               <p n="5">(5) and Laſtly, It may be added as a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Benefit and Priviledge of <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom;</hi> that Satan's Power (as before) is daſht in pieces, and we are ſafe under the defence and Protection of this mighty <hi>Monarch.</hi> The other Enemies who oppoſe his Authority, and do diſeaſe and trouble us, are <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> without, and <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Apoſtates</hi> within the Church; and all theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries have no ſmall Advantage againſt us, from that innate Corruption and Concupiſcence in our own Bowels: but all the hurt that Chriſt our <hi>King</hi> will ſuffer them to do us, is only by ſome faint En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters (now and then) to try and advance our Graces, and prove our Integrity. And tho' that laſt Enemy <hi>Death</hi> may be a preſent torture; yet cannot deprive us of that Bliſs, which ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the Reward of all his <hi>Subjects</hi> in another

We thy unworthy Servants deſire with all Humility to acknowledge our immediate Dependance upon thee: for by thy Power we were made, by thy Wiſdom we are govern'd, by thy Goodneſs we are provided for, under thy Dominion we live, and we owe unto thee all that we have in this World, or hope for in the next.</p>
            <p>And yet alas! we have made very unſutable returns unto thy Bounty: For we have violated all thy juſt &amp; reaſonable Commands, not only by our miſtakes and indiſcretions, by our ſudden, ſecret, and unobſerved Sins; but we have ſet at naught and trampled upon thy ſovereign Power and Authority, by our open, voluntary, deliberate, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Tranſgreſſions; to the diſhonour of thy glorious Name, the ſcandal of our holy Profeſſion, and the great encreaſe of our ſhame and ſorrow. Beſides, ſuch is the ignorance of our Minds, the ſtubborneſs of our Wills, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulineſs of our Affections, that we have been either whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:102388:141"/>negligent about, or careleſs and trifling in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of thoſe incomparably pleaſant Duties of our holy and excellent Religion: Whereby, much of our precious Time has been wickedly miſ-ſpent, either in ſinful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, or Idleneſs and Vanity. And to increaſe and aggravate our Guilt and Puniſhment, we have ſinned againſt many Judgements and Mercies, Vows and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, the Light of thy holy Spirit, and the many checks and convictions of our own Conſciences: by all which, we have made and judged our ſelves unworthy of eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Wherefore holy Father, we might juſtly expect the ſevereſt Reſentments of thy Wrath and Vengeance, in the moſt due and deſerved Puniſhment of all our Sins: But thou art a God of Mercy, and with thee is plenteous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; thy Promiſes are full in Chriſt Jeſus to truly humble and penitent Sinners: We come with boldneſs therefore to the Throne of thy heavenly Grace, moſt humbly begging the Aids of thy holy Spirit; that with a deep Sorrow and hearty Contrition, we may ſtedfaſtly bewail all the Sins and Offences of our paſt-lives.

            <p>O Lord, the Almighty Creator of the World, and the merciful Redeemer of Mankind, who ſeeſt our down lyings and upriſings, and to whom the Darkneſs and Light are both alike. Thou art a God of Infinite Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Holineſs, nor can any thing be added to thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Perfections and eſſential Glory, by us or any of thy Creatures: for thou reproveſt thy Angels of Folly, and the Heavens are impure before thee; much more might the ſenſe of our wretched Eſtate and Condition make us juſtly aſham'd and afraid to offer unto thee any Sacrifice; yet in great Mercy to our Souls thou heareſt Prayer, and thy Power and Goodneſs are every where manifeſt in the viſible Adminiſtrations of thy Providence. We beſeech thee therefore to accept of this Evening Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of our Souls and Bodies, which we deſire with all Humility to preſent a holy, living, and acceptable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto thee, thro' Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

But thou haſt graciouſly ſpar'd us hitherto when we deſerved Puniſhment, and in the midſt of Judgement thinkeſt upon Mercy. Wherefore O Lord, thy Mercy is our Sanctuary, and unto thee do we flie for Succour. Let the ſenſe of our Vileneſs poſſeſs us with an holy Indignation againſt our Selves; and give us Grace to look back upon the Offences of our former Lives with that horrour and regret, hatred and deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that neither our vile Luſts, the illuſions of Satan, nor the alluring Enticements of this vain and tranſitory World may prevail with us to neglect the great Concernments of Eternity.</p>
            <p>And for the perfecting of our preſent and future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, we beſeech thee O heavenly Father to be gracious and merciful unto us in the forgivenneſs of all our Sins. Pardon the vanity and impurity of our Thoughts; the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of our prophane, idle, and impertinent Words; and the Impurity, injuſtice, and Impiety of all our Actions.

            <p>And now O Lord, as we have pray'd unto thee for the ſupply of all temporal and ſpiritual Wants; ſo we beſeech thee to accept of the hearty Return of our moſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Praiſe and Thankſgiving, for the abundance of thy Grace and Mercy vouchſafed to our Souls and Bodies.

            <p>Finally we beg the Aſſiſtance of thy good Providence, which hath watcht over us, and preſerved us this Day, to defend us this Night alſo.

Bleſs the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, eſpecially the Churches of theſe Kingdoms: And herein I intreat thee for all temporal and ſpiritual Mercies, for the guidance and ſafety of the King's moſt excellent Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, the royal Family, and the whole Clergy of this Realm; but particularly for the Guide and Paſtor of our Souls in this Pariſh. Bleſs all the Nobility, Gentry, and Commonality, in their ſeveral Capacities and Callings. Be favourable and gracious to all my Relations, Friends and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors;
<pb facs="tcp:102388:148"/>and extend thy Mercy and Goodneſs to all (even my moſt inveterate and malicious) Enemies. Be propitious to thoſe who want the bleſſings and comforts which I enjoy: ſtrengthen the weak, confirm the ſtrong, inſtruct the ignorant, deliver the oppreſſed, relieve the needy, pity and ſupport the Fatherleſs and Widow, and bring us all by the Waters of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, &amp; in the Ways of Religion to thy Kingdom of reſt &amp; Glory.</p>
            <p>The holy Angels and Saints in heaven praiſe thee O Lord, extol thy Power, bleſs thy Goodneſs, and are aſtoniſhed at thy Wiſdom; the whole Earth is full of the Riches of thy Grace and Mercy. But thou haſt bleſt and oblig'd me more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, by all the endeared Expreſſions of love and bounty in my Creation, Preſervation, and all the Mercies and Comforts of this Life; but above all by the infinite Riches of thy Grace and Goodneſs, in fending thy Son to purchaſe my Peace and Pardon at ſo dear a price as the expence of his own bloud: And herein I thank thee with all my Soul, for his miraculous Birth, his moſt holy and innocent Life, for his bitter Agony and Paſſion, his Glorious Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, and his ſovereign Power and Authority over all the Creatures; for the ſprinkling of his Bloud, and his Interceſſion with the Father for us, and for the coming of the holy Ghoſt; for all the bleſſed Opportunities of Grace and Salvation here, and aſſured hope of eternal Glory hereafter. And to all thy other Mercies and Bleſſings thou haſt graciouſly added the Protection of me and mine in our Perſons and Poſſeſsions this Day; from all Caſualties and ill Accidents, from the power &amp; prevalence of our Enemies, and from thine infinite Wrath and Vengeance which might have deſervedly faln upon us. In like manner I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee preſerve my Soul and Body from all the Malice and Violence of the Spirits of Darkneſs, and ſuffer not any vain Thoughts or Dreams to diſturb or enſnare me. Bleſs &amp; ſanctifie my Sleep that it may be temperate, holy, and ſafe, and that I and all thine may be refreſhed from time to time with whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and moderate Reſt; that both our Souls and Bodies may not only ſerve thee with a never failing Duty, but that whether we wake or ſleep, live or die, we may be thine in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
